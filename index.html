<p> What is design? Most people think that design is about making things look pretty – a decoration. Art. 
    <br>But design is as much an art as it is a science. Cold and calculated process. 
    <br> Sometimes the detriment of pretty. Yet, the design is not allowed to fail. 
    <br>Design is for everyone and no one in particular. Website and mobile app design, 
    as well as design in general, is a complex yet subtle process, it’s more than making things pretty.</p>
